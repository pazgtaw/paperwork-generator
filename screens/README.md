# Chatlog Magician

Chatlog Magician, converts SA-MP logs into images, making screenshot editing easier. It's fully compatible with SA-MP.

## Features

* Removes timestamps from screenshots. 

* If available, it detects and adjusts hexadecimal color codes within curly brackets.

* It automatically detects whispering status and emotes in the chat and adjusts the line color accordingly.

## Examples
### Emote

```
* Martin Peterson looks around nervously, sweating slightly as he waits for his contact to arrive.
* Can you see what's on the back seat of the car? (( Martin Peterson ))
